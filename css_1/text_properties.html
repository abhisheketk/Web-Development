    <h4>Filming</h4>
    <p>Production was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California.[87] Howard Hughes was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the Hughes H-4 Hercules was built.[22] Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.[16]</p>

    <h4>Post-production</h4>
    <p>Favreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.[100] He hired Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Transformers. The Orphanage and The Embassy did additional work,[22] with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor.[101] To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit,[22] and skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel to study the physics of flying.[102] For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.[103] Favreau conceived of the head-up display shots so audiences would not become disconnected from Stark when watching scenes with the CG Iron Man.[66]: 81 </p>
    <h3>Cast</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:
An industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. Director Jon Favreau felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part[9] and that the actor could not only make Stark a "likable asshole," but also portray an authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience.[10] Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, Shane Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man.[11] Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,[12] especially when it came to adding humor to the film.[13] Downey explained, "What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into Dudley Do-Right, and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' </p>
